## Rejection Sampling

This repository contains several types of programs:

- `Homework_5.x`  
- `Random.py`

The exercise I attempted was the first option. I tried adding in a different function, but I don't think I got the sampling of that function down right becuase the plot ended up wonky with the target function and proposal function intersecting. Since you said we just had to try these exercises, I thought it might be best to leave it here and continue to work and ask you how to get this working. I did include the plot I generated for reference. 

In the program: `More_attempts.py` I do try more ways to get thsi working. 
Additionally I added in two plots that are definitely wrong that outputted while I was problem solving

### Requirements

In order to compile (by typing `make`) and run the C++ examples, you
need the ROOT package installed (for visualization):
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (C++)

The python scripts require the following libraries: `numpy` and `matplotlib`

### Usage

All of the executables can be called from the
command line with the `-h` or `--help` flag, which will print the options

The python scripts can be run with the following options
- `python python/Homework_5.py -Nsample [# samples] -range [Xmax] --log --expo`
- `python python/More_attempts.py -Nsample [# samples] -range [Xmax] --log --expo`
